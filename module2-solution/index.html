			<h2>Biryani, India</h2>
		</div>
		<p>A celebration of spices and rice, biryani's origins lie with the Muslims of the Indian subcontinent. Today, endless varieties of biryani exist, depending on the region where it's cooked, but the basics – rice and an assortment of spices – remain untouchable. You can make yours with meat or skip it for a vegan or vegetarian treat. </p>

			<h2>Poke, Hawaii, USA</h2>
		</div>
		<p>The native Hawaiian diced raw fish dish, meaning 'to slice' in Hawaiian, has surged in popularity across the US in recent years, probably due to the appeal of its healthy, fresh ingredients. But this taste of the sea has ancient roots that date back a long time, when native islanders would rub sea salt, seaweed and traditional relish inamona into their fresh catches.</p>

			<h2>Ceviche, Peru</h2>
		</div>
		<p>This dish is so much a part of Peru's heritage that the country has a holiday to celebrate it on 28 June. Chunks of raw fish are marinated for a couple of minutes in lime juice along with onions, chilli peppers, salt and oil. Traditionally, ceviche is served at room temperature with sides like corn and sweet or white potatoes and a cold beer.</p>
